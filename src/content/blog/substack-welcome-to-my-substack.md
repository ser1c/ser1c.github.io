<p>If you are seeing this, I either shared it personally and you want to support me, or you are part of the class I took recently. Anyhow, welcome to my first post.</p><p>I enjoy teaching and learning causal inference, reading papers, and listening to the discussions of top researchers in the field. I do this daily and make notes as well. So, I thought maybe this could be helpful for somebody out there.<br><br>I will share important life events, PhD events, interesting papers, and interesting topics that I find interesting. If you are not interested, please do not hesitate to unsubscribe. <br><br>Most of my posts will be available for free subscriptions since the major goal of this blog is to help students in lower&#8212;and middle-income countries like Nepal gaze into the life of academia and have a community to discuss it with. If posts are under a paywall, they will be made free in a week.</p><p>If you think there is someone who would benefit from this, please share this substack with them.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://sabinsubedi.substack.com/leaderboard?&amp;utm_source=post&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Refer a friend&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://sabinsubedi.substack.com/leaderboard?&amp;utm_source=post"><span>Refer a friend</span></a></p><p>I hope to make at least one post a week and, if interesting, multiple ones. Feel free to comment, and if necessary, I will also start a discussion thread if the comments are interesting.</p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://sabinsubedi.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sabin's Substack!
