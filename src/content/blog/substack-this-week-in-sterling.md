<p>Today's post is just a life update. I am writing this from the student halls at the University of Sterling. I am here for five days for Summer School, followed by a workshop on the Economics of Crime. While writing this, I am also watching England vs Slovakia game at the Euros. Slovakia is goal up, and I can only imagine what the media is going to do if England loose this one.</p><p>Now, to the content of this post, the SGPE Summer School is led by Professor Scott Cunningham from Baylor University. He is one of the individuals that I look up to in the causal inference atmoshphere. I have taken his Causal Inferences courses before and found them really helpful. So, if you get the chance to take one, do it.</p><p>This week, I will try to distill all of the learnings in a series of blog posts. These five days will cover the following topics:</p><ol><li><p>Foundations of Casual Inference</p></li><li><p>Unconfoundedness/ Selection on Observables</p></li><li><p>Regression Discontinuity Designs</p></li><li><p>Instrumental Variables</p></li><li><p>Economics of Crime Workshop</p></li></ol><p>So, look out for posts related to these topics. And also comment if there are any specific topics you want to learn/hear about. If you think there is anyone who would benefit from this blog post feel free to share it to them.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://sabinsubedi.substack.com/leaderboard?&amp;utm_source=post&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Refer a friend&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://sabinsubedi.substack.com/leaderboard?&amp;utm_source=post"><span>Refer a friend</span></a></p><p>Have a great week ahead!</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://sabinsubedi.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Sabin's Substack is a reader-supported publication.
