## Abstract

This study investigates the impact of remittances on farm productivity in the aftermath of the 2015 Nepal 
earthquake, addressing a critical gap in our understanding of how private financial flows affect economic outcomes
     during times of crisis. Employing a triple difference strategy and using exchange rates as an instrument for 
     remittances, we find that a 10\% increase in remittances leads to a 1.5\% decrease in farm productivity 
     for earthquake-affected households. This effect is pronounced in the short term but dissipates by the third 
     year post-earthquake. Our analysis reveals that remittance-receiving households prioritize immediate recovery 
     needs over agricultural investments, suggesting a trade-off between short-term disaster relief and maintaining 
     productivity in key economic sectors. The study utilizes comprehensive household survey data, and rigorous 
     econometric techniques to establish causality. Our findings 
     have important implications for policymakers in remittance-dependent countries prone to natural disasters, 
     highlighting the need for integrated approaches that leverage remittances for immediate relief while supporting
      agricultural productivity.
